# (WIP) Welcome to the repository for my master in Econometrics' thesis

## In here, you'll find the main Python script (main.py) used to produce the results presented in my [thesis' working document](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d63d1b61a2e616c96870053), as well as the shareable and more digestible IPython Notebook (Jupyter Notebook), main_notebook.ipnb.
